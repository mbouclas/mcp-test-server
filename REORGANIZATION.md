# Project Reorganization Summary

## Overview
Successfully reorganized the MCP server project by moving JavaScript files from the root directory into organized subdirectories within the `src/` folder.

## Changes Made

### File Movements
- **Examples**: Moved all example services and web API servers to `src/examples/`
- **Tests**: Moved all test files to `src/tests/`
- **Frontend**: Moved all frontend files (JS and HTML) to `src/frontend/`
- **Utils**: Moved utility and debug scripts to `src/utils/`

### Cleanup
- Removed duplicate JavaScript files from `src/` that had corresponding TypeScript sources
- Updated import paths in moved files to correctly reference the `build/` directory
- Updated `package.json` scripts to reflect new file locations

### Documentation
- Added README.md files to each subdirectory explaining their contents and usage
- Maintained proper TypeScript build process through `npm run build`

## New Structure
```
src/
├── examples/     # Example services and web API servers
├── frontend/     # Frontend applications and HTML files
├── tests/        # Test files for various components
├── utils/        # Utility scripts and development tools
├── config.ts     # Core TypeScript source files
├── index.ts
├── ollama-bridge.ts
└── setup.ts
```

## Benefits
1. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
2. **Easier Navigation**: Related files grouped together
3. **Cleaner Root**: Reduced clutter in project root
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and maintain specific types of files
5. **Documentation**: Each subfolder has its own README

## Usage
All npm scripts have been updated to work with the new structure:
- `npm run example-service`
- `npm run test-integration`
- `npm run chat`
- `npm run web-api`
- etc.

The TypeScript build process remains unchanged and continues to output to the `build/` directory.
